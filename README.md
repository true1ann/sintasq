# Sintasq

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I repeat, ***VERY IMPORTANT***. Sintasq is literally is in THE most raw state right now. Dont expect it to work. For now use NeoRender (See my GitHub profile), but DO KEEP IN MIND ITS **NO LONGER SUPPORTED**

## So what is Sintasq/`st`?

You know NeoRender? So basically `st` is NeoRender if it was good, like, modularized, maintainable and without that '100% stable mark', ***any update can break your components and/or themes. Be sure to ALWAYS use static versions, and review update changes carefully***, this is a small trade off for the sake of speed and functionality.

> If, by some miracle (not really) you dont know what NeoRender (`nr`) is, basically, like `st`, `nr` is a CSR (Client-side Renderring) Framework, SEO goes to hell with this at the trade off of faster website updates and less work

## How can I begin using `st`?

You fucking dont, its not done
